# Pharmacy-Management
This is the Project based on manage, Stock up and Check who are all ordered the product by using this Website. I am using HTML and CSS for Front-End and JSP with Database connectivity for Back-End.

To run this project, We need some software.

Mainly we need XAMMP for start the phpmyadmin(Database) and Server.

I used SQL database and Tomcat server. And i built my project in NetBeans because i was bit familiar with this IDE.

Project Starting method : 

First, Start the server and phpmyadmin. Then go to netbean and build the project, but before build the project I configure some settings in IDE to make my project run perfectly.

Secondly, After configured and successfully build the project, the IDE automatically run the project in the browser, which is preferred in the configure part(I selected Google Chrome). Then I check the Testcase and UI Test.
